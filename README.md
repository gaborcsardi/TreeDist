# TreeDist
This package exists to implement a suite of tree distance metrics.

It adds to functions that already exist in `ape`, `phangorn` and `Quartet`. #TODO: More details to follow.

# Installation


Install and load the library from CRAN as follows:
```
#TODO: submit to CRAN!
install.packages('TreeDist')
library('TreeDist')
```

If you're feeling brave, you can install the development version thus:
```r
if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github('ms609/TreeDist')
```
