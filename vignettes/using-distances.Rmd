Once you understand [how to use TreeDist](Using-TreeDist.html) to calculate
tree distances, and [what distances measure](tree-distances.html), the next
step is to provide some context for the calculated distances.

## Normalizing

The maximum value of most tree distance metrics scales with the number of 
terminals in the trees being compared.  Often, the resolution of the trees
impacts the range of possible values too.




## Testing similarity to a known tree

- The precision/accuracy distinction

- The role of information

- A ternary plotting approach
